# Excel-Sales-Analysis
My first Excel Sales Dashboard, analyzing sales, profit, and orders with PivotTables, charts, and slicers.
Hello, This is my very first Sales Dshboard built completely in Microsoft Excel.  
The goal was simple: take raw sales data and turn it into something **visual, interactive, and insightful**.  
I wanted to see how sales, profit, and orders looked when broken down by categories, states, and time.  
What the Dashboard Shows
Key Metrics (KPIs) 
  - Total Sales  
  - Total Profit  
  - Total Quantity  
  - Total Orders  
  - Profit Margin  
Visual Insights
  - üìà Month-wise Sales & Profit trend  
  - üìä Category-wise Profit (Waterfall chart)  
  - üç© Category-wise Sales split (Donut chart)  
  - üó∫ Sales by State (Map)  
  - ‚≠ê Top 5 Sub-categories by Sales  
Interactive Filters (Slicers)
  - Order Year  
  - Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)  
  - Region (Central, East, South, West)  
 Tools & Skills Used - Microsoft Excel
  - PivotTables & PivotCharts  
  - Slicers for interactivity  
  - Conditional formatting for KPIs  
- Data cleaning & organizing raw data  
- Dashboard design & layout planning  
Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the dashboard:

 What I Learned
- How to structure raw data so that it‚Äôs dashboard-ready  
- The power of PivotTables & slicers for quick analysis  
- Designing with simplicity, making a dashboard that‚Äôs not just functional but also clean and easy to read  
- Most importantly: the satisfaction of building my first full dashboard project!

This is just the beginning. I‚Äôll keep adding more projects as I continue learning **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI**. The goal is to build a solid portfolio and keep improving with each project.
